# __Crillion - own reproduction__
#### This is a reproduction of Crillion game released on Commodore 64. The project was written in TypeScript using WebPack. CSS was used for styling.
#### For the purposes of the project I created three different levels, each presenting different block mechanics (shown on screens).
##### RULES: Destroy all plain blocks. To do this, the ball must be in the color of the block. Blocks with an asterisk symbol are used to change the color of the ball. To self-destruct (lose the attempt) you have to press the "o" button.
